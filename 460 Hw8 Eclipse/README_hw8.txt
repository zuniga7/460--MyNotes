Our program creates a website in which an average user can find information about their notes without knowing any query language.
For extra credit we decided to make the website look better by adding a background and buttons that are similar to a notebook. By
having the changed look it makes the website look more professional. For extra functionality we decided to increase the robustness
of the website, by checking for legal input and showing errors when the criteria is not met. Specifically we check that the date
is a valid date when adding a card, as well as requiring all fields to be filled before submitting a page.
